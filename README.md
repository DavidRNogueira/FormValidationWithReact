# Form Validation With React

This project is a demonstration of 'for' loops, if/else statements, React Routing.
It also demonstartes some styling (JSX/CSS)

## Things to notice

Something to notice is that the log in can take any combination of correct and incorrect inputs and it will always respond with the correct error message depending on what is right or wrong with the input value.

It is also important to notice that, though the dashboard hasn't been styled, the system knows when to route the page to the user's dashboard page.
